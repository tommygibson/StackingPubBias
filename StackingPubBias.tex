\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Results from a meta-analysis may be skewed and unreliable in the presence of publication bias, where the publication or non-publication of a study depends on the statistical significance or magnitude of its results \citep{rothstein2006}. Statistical methods for publication bias have been designed for sensitivity analysis, testing for the presence/magnitude of publication bias, and calculating bias-corrected parameter estimates. Most methods are either based on the funnel plot or selection models.

Methods based on the funnel plot \citep{light1984funnel} -- a scatterplot of effect sizes against their standard errors -- inspect the plot's asymmetry to test or correct for bias. Say we have $S$ studies indexed by $i = 1,\dots,S$ and that ${y_i}$ and ${v_i} = {s_i^2}$ are their estimated effect sizes and sampling variances. A popular non-parametric test for publication bias \citep{begg1994test} measures the rank correlation between standardized observed effect sizes $y_i^*$ and the effect sizes' variances $v_i$, where 
\begin{align}
y_i^* &= (y_i - \overline{y}) / (v_i^*)^{1/2} \nonumber \\
\overline{y} &= \Big( \sum_j (v_i^{-1})/ y_i \Big) / \Big( \sum_j v_i^{-1} \Big) \nonumber \\
v_i^* &= v_i - \Big( \sum_j v_i^{-1} \Big)^{-1}. \nonumber
\end{align}
\citet{begg1994test} measure the correlation between pairs $(y_i^*, v_i)$ with Kendall's tau, where a symmetric funnel plot would have correlation near zero. Egger's test \citep{egger1997test} fits a linear regression of observed standard normal deviates $\text{SND}_i = y_i / s_i$ against the inverse standard errors $1 / s_i$, i.e. $\text{SND}_i = \alpha + \beta \times (1 / s_i)$  with the null hypothesis $H_0: \alpha = 0$. Other regression methods \citep{macaskill2001test, rucker2008arcsine, thompson1999test, peters2006test} are similar to Egger's test and use regression weights or transformations to improve upon Egger's test in the presence of heterogeneity or for dichotomous outcomes \citep{jin2015methods}. \citet{lin2018test} develops a measure for the severity of publication bias based on the skewness of standardized deviates. The trim-and-fill method \citep{duval2000biom} calculates an adjusted mean effect estimate in a series of steps, by 1) estimating the number of missing studies $k_0$, 2) ``trimming" the smaller studies that are causing funnel plot asymmetry, 3) estimating the true mean effect with the remaining studies, and 4) replacing trimmed studies and their missing counterparts and re-estimating the mean effect and its variance. However, \citet{duval2000biom} recommend using trim-and-fill as a sensitivity analysis based on the \textit{potential} number of missing studies, with general guidelines for sensitivity analysis given in \citet{shi2019trim}. The trim-and-fill method is the only funnel plot-based method that offers an adjusted mean estimate, and it is not recommended if there is heterogeneity in study effects \citep{jin2015methods}.

A second class of methods is based on \textit{selection models}, first described in \citet{hedges1984selection}. Let $Y$ be a random variable representing effect sizes for all studies in a population and let $\Theta$ be the parameters determining the sampling density $f(y;\Theta)$. Selection models assume a biased sampling scheme where the probability of a study being observed (published) is represented by a weight function $w(y; \lambda)$, where $\lambda$, a scalar or vector parameter, determines how certain studies may be more or less likely to be published. The weighted density for observed effect $y_i$ is then
\begin{equation}
f^*(y_i ;  \Theta, \lambda) = \frac{f(y_i;\Theta) w(y_i; \lambda)}{\int f(y ; \Theta) w(y; \lambda) dy}
\end{equation}
and the likelihood function for all observed studies is 
\begin{equation}
L(\Theta, \lambda) = \prod_{i = 1}^S f^*(y_i; \Theta, \lambda).
\end{equation}
Some models explicitly model the probability of publication for individual studies as a function of their p-values \citep{iyengar1988selection, hedges1992selection, givens1997, vevea1995pubbias} or as a function of both the effect size and standard error \citep{copas1999what, copas2000funnel, copas2001sensitivity}. \citet{hedges1992selection} introduced stepped weight functions by dividing the unit interval [0, 1] into $K$ segments with $K-1$ cut points, where studies that have $p$-values in different segments have different probabilities of publication. We refer to stepped selection functions by the number of cut points, i.e. a 1-step selection function might have a single cut point at $p=0.05$, or a 2-step function might have cuts at $p=0.05, 0.10$. Earlier selection models were recommended for bias-corrected effect size estimates, and were later recommended only for sensitivity analyses because of identifiability issues in smaller meta-analyses \citep{vevea2005sensitivity, jin2015methods}. Sensitivity analyses use a grid representing varying levels of publication bias and estimate the mean effect under each assumed scenario. If results do not change much under an assumption of severe publication bias they are robust, and if results do change under an assumption of mild publication bias they are sensitive. Bayesian implementations of the Copas selection model \citep{mavridis2013copas, bai2020} have again allowed for estimation of mean effect sizes.

Recent approaches to mitigating publication bias have used Bayesian model averaged meta-analysis (BMA-MA) to consider a set of potential selection functions. \citet{guan2016} considers four different selection functions based on $p$-values, including a no-bias model, an extreme-bias model where studies with p-values $p > \alpha$ are never published, a 1-step function where studies with $p > \alpha$ are published with some probability $\pi < 1$, and a model where the probability of publication decreases exponentially with $p$. \citet{guan2016} only implement the models in a fixed-effects framework. \citet{maier2020robma} evaluates a set of 12 models, using a $2 \times 2 \times 2$ factorial design with fixed/random effects, a true null/alternative hypothesis, and the presence/absence of publication bias. \citet{maier2020robma} fit two-step and three-step selection functions based on p-values when publication bias is assumed, where the probability of publication changes at $p=0.05$ (one-step) or at both $p = 0.05$ and $p = 0.10$ (two-step).  

Bayesian model averaging (BMA) effectively assumes that one of the considered models is the ``true" model, which is called the $\mathcal{M}$-closed setting \citep{bernardo2009}. BMA does not perform as well under the $\mathcal{M}$-complete or $\mathcal{M}$-open settings, where the true data generating mechanism is too complex to implement or to put into a probabilistic framework \citep{bernardo2009, le2017stacking}. Multiple issues arise for BMA in these settings, including (a) the need to specify prior model probabilities, which makes little sense when we know the true model is not in our list, and (b) the model weights from BMA will converge to 1 for the model ``closest" to the true model in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence, and 0 for all others \citep{clyde2013bma}. Bayesian stacking of predictive distributions \citep{yao2018stacking, yao2021hierarchical} is a method that outperforms Bayesian model averaging in the $\mathcal{M}$-complete and $\mathcal{M}$-open settings and avoids issues (a) and (b) above. If we have $K$ candidate models $M_1, \dots, M_K$, \citet{yao2018stacking} solve for model weights $w = (w_1, \dots, w_K)$ under the constraint $w \in \mathcal{S}_1^K$ where $\mathcal{S}_1^K = \{w \in [0,1]^K : \sum_{k=1}^K w_k = 1\}$. They do this by solving
\begin{equation}
(\hat{w}_1, \dots, \hat{w}_K) =  \underset{w \in \mathcal{S}_1^K}{\mbox{max}} \: \frac{1}{S} \sum_{i = 1}^n \log \sum_{k = 1}^K w_k p(y_i \vert y_{-i}, M_k)
\end{equation}
where $p(y_i \vert y_{-i}, M_k)$ is the leave-one-out (LOO) posterior predictive density with the $i$th data point left out evaluated at $y_i$. It would be computationally costly to refit each model $M_k$ $S$ times, so LOO densities $p(y_i \vert y_{-i}, M_k)$ are approximated using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling \citep{vehtari2017psis}. We go through Bayesian stacking more thoroughly in Section \ref{sec:stacking}.

Given that the true data generating mechanism for publication bias is likely much too complex to be specified in a simple selection model, we propose using Bayesian stacking to mitigate publication bias by fitting multiple Bayesian selection models and stacking over them. Assumed patterns of publication bias that poorly predict the observed data with LOO cross validation will be given little weight. We propose stacking over multiple types of models, including step functions \citep{vevea1995pubbias} and Bayesian Copas selection models \citet{mavridis2013copas, bai2020}. Section \ref{sec:methods} describes relevant selection models for publication bias, Bayesian stacking, and how to implement Bayesian stacking of selection models. We then describe and summarize a simulation study in Section \ref{sec:simulation}. The purpose of the simulation is to compare a stacked estimate of the mean effect size to estimates from individual selection models when the true data generator is not one of the fitted selection models. We apply the stacked model to a real dataset on the effectiveness of antidepressants in Section \ref{sec:numex}

\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}

We are doing a meta-analysis and have $S$ studies indexed by $i = 1, \dots, S$, and each study provides an estimated effect $y_i$ and an associated standard error $s_i$. Assuming estimates $y_i$ are normally distributed, we calculate study $i$'s 2-sided $p$-value as $p_i = 2 \times \big(1 - \Phi(\vert y_i \vert / s_i)\big)$ where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. The data model for each selection method is
\begin{align}
y_i & = \theta_i + s_i \epsilon_i \label{eq:y} \\
\theta_i \vert \theta, \tau ^ 2 & \sim \mbox{N}(\theta, \tau ^ 2) \label{eq:thetai}
\end{align}
where $\theta_i$ represent random study effects normally distributed around global mean $\theta$ with variance $\tau^2$, and $\epsilon_i \sim \text{N}(0, 1)$. For stepped weight functions we combine $s_i^2$ and $\tau^2$ into a single residual so that
\begin{align}
y_i \vert \theta, \tau^2 &\sim \text{N}(\theta, s_i^2 + \tau^2).
\end{align}

\subsection{Selection models based on p-values} \label{sec:pvalue}

We define a stepped weight function $w(\cdot)$ similar to \citet{vevea1995pubbias} and \citet{vevea2005sensitivity}, where $w(p)$ represents the probability that a study with $p$-value $p$ is observed. Dividing the unit interval into $K$ sub-intervals with descending endpoints $a_k$ in which the weight function $w(p)$ is constant, we have that
\begin{equation} % weight function
w(p_i) =
	\begin{cases}
		\omega_1 & \text{if $a_1 < p_i < 1$} \\
		\omega_j & \text{if $a_{j} < p_i < a_{j-1}$} \\
		\omega_K & \text{if $0 < p_i < a_{K-1}$}
	\end{cases} \label{eq:weight_fcn}
\end{equation}
where $a_0 = 1$ and $a_K = 0$. Say $\boldsymbol{\omega} = (\omega_1, \dots, \omega_K)$. We then have that the likelihood contribution for each observation $y_i$ given $\theta$, $\tau^2$ and weight function $w(\cdot)$ is 
\begin{equation} % weighted normal pdf
f(y_i \vert \theta, \tau^2, \boldsymbol{\omega}) = \frac{\phi(y_i ; \theta, \tau^2 + s_i^2) \times w(p_i)}{\int \phi(x ; \theta, \tau^2 + s_i^2) \times w(1 - \Phi(x/2)) dx}, \label{eq:weightednormal}
\end{equation}
where $\phi(x; a, b)$ represents a normal probability density function with mean $a$ and variance $b$. \citet{maier2020robma} place a ``cumulative-Dirichlet" prior distribution on the weights $\boldsymbol{\omega}$, which effectively means placing a symmetric Dirichlet prior on an auxiliary parameter $\widetilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}} \in (0, 1)^K$ and taking the cumulative sum 
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\widetilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}} & \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\text{rep}(1, K))  \\
\boldsymbol{\omega} &= \text{cumulative-sum}(\widetilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}). 
\end{split}
\end{align}
This restricts $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ so that the $K$ intervals in \eqref{eq:weight_fcn} have increasing probability of publication with decreasing $p$-values, and $\omega_K = 1$. The symmetric Dirichlet prior on $\widetilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}$ leads to prior means $(\frac{1}{K}, \frac{2}{K}, \dots, 1)$ for $\boldsymbol{\omega}$. Restricting $\omega_K = 1$ means each other $\omega_j$ represents the probability of publication for a study in interval $j$ relative to the probability of publication in the lowest interval. We consider a range of possible structures for the weight function $w(p)$ by varying both the number of intervals $K$ and the choice of cut-points $a_j$.

%We place weakly informative Normal and half-Cauchy \citep{gelman2006prior} distributions on $\theta_0$ and $\tau$ as
%\begin{align}
%\begin{split}
%\theta_0 & \sim \text{N}(0, 10 ^ 2) \\
%\tau & \sim \text{half-Cauchy}(0, 1).
%\end{split}
%\end{align}

\subsection{Copas selection model} \label{sec:copas}

The Copas selection model \citep{copas1999what, copas2000funnel, copas2001sensitivity} models the selection mechanism for publication as a function of study effect $y_i$ and associated standard error $s_i$. We introduce a latent variable $z_i$ modeled as
\begin{align}
z_i &= \gamma_0 + \frac{\gamma_1}{s_i} + \delta_i, \label{eq:zi} 
\end{align}
where $z_i$ models the publication process such that study $i$ is selected (published) only if $z_i > 0$. The parameter $\gamma_0$ controls the baseline probability of publication, and $\gamma_1$ defines the relationship between the observed standard deviation $s_i$ and the probability of publication. Usually $\gamma_1$ is assumed to be positive, so that studies with smaller standard errors are more likely to be published. The random effects $(\epsilon_i, \delta_i)$ are modeled as bivariate normal
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_i \\
\delta_i
\end{pmatrix}\sim N\left(\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
0
\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \rho \\
\rho & 1
\end{pmatrix}\right) \label{eq:epsilon}
\end{align}
where corr$(\epsilon_i, \delta_i) = \rho$ measures how the probability of selection changes with observed effect sizes.

Interpretation of the parameters $(\gamma_0, \gamma_1, \rho)$ can be difficult. The marginal probability that a study with standard error $s_i$ is published is 
\begin{align}
P(z_i > 0 \vert s_i) = \Phi(\gamma_0 + \frac{\gamma_1}{s_i}). \nonumber
\end{align}
Thus, if $\gamma_0$ is large and positive then all studies are published with high probability regardless of the value of $s_i$. We restrict $\gamma_1$ to be positive under the assumption that larger studies are more likely to be published for various reasons (e.g. more funding, quality of writing, etc.). Larger values of $\gamma_1$ lead to larger differences in publication probabilities for studies with different standard errors. The correlation parameter $\rho$ is the main driver in how unadjusted estimates of $\theta$ are biased from the truth. If $\rho = 0$, then the selection process does not depend on observed effect sizes and unadjusted estimates are unbiased. Positive values of $\rho$ indicate that observed effects $y_i$ influence the selection process such that larger values of $y_i$ (relative to their true mean $\theta_i$) are being selected for, while negative values of $\rho$ would show selection favoring larger negative values of $y_i$.

We consider two Bayesian adaptations of the Copas model \citep{mavridis2013copas, bai2020}, which put prior distributions on all parameters including $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$. \citet{mavridis2013copas} instead places priors on the lower and upper bounds for the probability of publication, $P_{\text{low}}$ and $P_{\text{high}}$, as
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
P_{\text{low}} & \sim \text{Uniform}(L_1, L_2) \\
P_{\text{high}} & \sim \text{Uniform}(U_1, U_2), \label{eq:mavgamma}
\end{split}
\end{align} 
where $(L_1, L_2)$ and $(U_1, U_2)$ represent plausible ranges for the probability of publication for the studies with the largest and smallest standard errors, respectively. They then transform $(P_{\text{low}}, P_{\text{high}})$ to $(\gamma_0, \gamma_1)$ with a 1-to-1 transformation using
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\gamma_0 + \frac{\gamma_1}{s_{\text{max}}} &= \Phi^{-1}(P_{\text{low}}) \\
\gamma_0 + \frac{\gamma_1}{s_{\text{min}}} &= \Phi^{-1}(P_{\text{high}})
\end{split}
\end{align} 
where $s_{\text{min}}$ and $s_{\text{max}}$ are the smallest and largest observed standard errors in the sample of $S$ studies. \citet{bai2020} place priors directly on $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ as
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\gamma_0 & \sim \text{Uniform}(-2, 2) \\
\gamma_1 & \sim \text{Uniform}(0, s_{\text{max}}). \label{eq:baigamma}
\end{split}
\end{align}
They reason that this range of values allows for selection probabilities between 2.5\% and 99.7\% by restricting most of the mass for latent variables $z_i$ to the range $(-2, 3)$.
Priors \eqref{eq:baigamma} are meant to be default prior distributions, while \eqref{eq:mavgamma} may require more problem-specific tuning, and the two priors lead to surprisingly different posterior distributions for the mean parameter $\theta$. 

\subsection{Bayesian stacking} \label{sec:stacking}

We use $\mathcal{M}$-open to refer to the setting in which our list of candidate models does not include the true data generating mechanism \citep{bernardo2009}. Bayesian stacking \citep{yao2018stacking} is an alternative to BMA that has superior performance in the $\mathcal{M}$-open setting. If we have $K$ candidate models, the goal is to find the set of optimal weights $w \in \mathcal{S}_1^K$, $\mathcal{S}_1^K = \{w \in [0,1]^K \: : \: \sum_{k = 1}^K w_k = 1\}$, that maximizes a score $S$ comparing weighted predictive distributions  $p_k(\tilde{y} \vert y, M_k)$ to the true distribution $p_t(\tilde{y} \vert y)$. Rather than requiring holdout data $\tilde{y}$ and \citet{yao2018stacking} replace $p(\tilde{y} \vert y)$ with observed values $y_i$ and replace $p(\tilde{y} \vert y, M_k)$ with its corresponding leave-one-out (LOO) predictive distribution $\hat{p}_{k, -i}(y_i) = \int p(Y_i \vert \theta_k, M_k) p(\theta_k \vert y_{-i}, M_k) d\theta_k$, where $M_k$ is model $k, k = 1, \dots, K$, and $\theta_k$ are the parameters in model $k$. The authors recommend the logarithmic scoring rule, which reduces the stacking problem to solving for weights $w$ in 
\begin{align}
\underset{w \in \mathcal{S}_1^K}{\mbox{max}} \: \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \log \sum_{k = 1}^K w_k p(y_i \vert y_{-i}, M_k)
\end{align}
via optimization. Instead of refitting each model $n$ times to obtain LOO distributions ${p}_{k}(y_i \vert y_{-i} M_k)$, \citet{yao2018stacking} use Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS) \citep{vehtari2017psis} to obtain approximations. 

After stacking weights $w$ have been optimized, the stacked posterior distribution of $\theta$ can be obtained by taking $w_k \times T$ samples from each model $k$'s posterior distribution $p(\theta \vert y)$ for a total of $T$ posterior samples. 


Implementation of Bayesian stacking can be done using the R package `loo'. 


\subsection{Stacking selection models for publication bias} \label{sec:stacked_models}

It would be naive to think that either the stepped selection functions in Section \ref{sec:pvalue} or the Copas models in Section \ref{sec:copas} represent the true data generating mechanism for publication bias. As Bayesian stacking is designed to perform well in the event that our model list does not contain the true model, we propose stacking over both Copas models  \citep{mavridis2013copas, bai2020} and a variety of stepped selection functions to obtain a more robust posterior distribution for the mean parameter $\theta$. 

To fit the Copas models we rewrite model \eqref{eq:copas_y} - \eqref{eq:copas_theta} as 
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}
y_i \\
z_i
\end{pmatrix}\sim \text{N} \left(\begin{pmatrix}
\theta \\
u_i
\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}
\tau^2 + s_i^2 & \rho s_i \\
\rho s_i & 1
\end{pmatrix}\right) \mathbbm{1}_{z_i > 0}, \label{eq:copas_rewrite}
\end{align}
which shows that we can first sample $z_i$ from a truncated normal $z_i \sim \text{N}(u_i, 1) \mathbbm{1}_{z_i > 0}$, and then sample $y_i \vert z_i \sim \text{N}\big(\text{E}[y_i \vert z_i], \text{Var}[y_i \vert z_i]\big)$ where $\text{E}[y_i \vert z_i] = \theta + \rho s_i (z_i - u_i)$ and $\text{Var}[y_i \vert z_i] = \tau^2 + s_i^2 (1 - \rho ^ 2)$ \citep{mavridis2013copas}. We also need to extract the log-likelihood for each observation $i$ in order to stack models. The model construction \eqref{eq:copas_rewrite} leads to a simple form for the log-likelihood 
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
L(\theta, \tau^2, \rho, \gamma_0, \gamma_1) &= \sum_{i = 1} ^ S \log[p(y_i \vert z_i > 0, s_i)] \\
& = \sum_{i = 1} ^ S \log \Bigg[ \frac{p(z_i > 0 \vert y_i, s_i) f(y_i)}{p(z_i > 0 \vert s_i)} \Bigg] \\
& = \sum_{i = 1} ^ S \log\big(\phi(y_i ; \theta, \tau^2)\big) - \log \Phi(u_i) + \log \Phi(v_i) \label{eq:loglik}
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $\phi(y_i; \theta, \tau^2)$ represents the density at the point $y_i$ of a normal distribution with mean $\theta$ and variance $\tau^2$, $\Phi(\cdot)$ represents the standard normal cumulative density function, and 
\begin{align}
u_i &= \gamma_0 + \frac{\gamma_1}{s_i} \nonumber \\
v_i &= \frac{u_i + \tilde{\rho}_i \frac{y_i - \theta}{\sqrt{\tau^2 + s_i^2}}}{\sqrt{(1 - \tilde{\rho}_i^2)}} \nonumber \\
\tilde{\rho_i} &= \frac{s_i}{(\tau^2 + s_i^2)^{1/2}} \rho. \nonumber
\end{align}
While \citet{bai2020} use default prior distributions \eqref{baigamma} for the parameters $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$, \citet{mavridis2013copas} instead advise users to use expert elicitation or historical data to specify $(L_1, L_2)$ and $(U_1, U_2)$ in \eqref{mavgamma}. To avoid this, we specify $(L_1, L_2) = (0.01, 0.5)$ and $(U_1, U_2) = (0.5, 0.99)$, meaning we believe the lower bound for publication probability is between 1-50\%, and the upper bound is between 50-99\%. \citet{mavridis2013copas} gives $\tau$ a half-normal prior, while \citet{bai2020} uses a half-Cauchy prior 
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\tau & \sim \text{N}(0, 10^2) \mathbbm{1}_{\tau > 0} \\
\tau & \sim \text{Cauchy}(0, 1) \mathbbm{1}_{\tau > 0}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
We fit Copas models in JAGS \citep{plummer2003jags}.

As a default, we fit a 1-step model with the step at $p=0.05$, a two-step model with steps at $p = (0.01, 0.10)$, and a two-step model with steps $p = (0.05, 0.20)$. We fit the stepped selection models in Stan \citep{gelman2015stan} because of the ability to easily code the custom probability distribution \eqref{eq:weightednormal}, which also makes extraction of the log-likelihood matrix simple. 

\section{Simulation} \label{sec:simulation}

The aim of the simulation is to assess how well the stacked model described in Section \ref{sec:stacked_models} \textit{stacks up} against the individual models $<$please help me find a way to keep the pun in here$>$. We simulate data for meta-analyses using a $2\times3$ factorial design with $\theta = (0, 0.4)$ and number of studies per meta analysis $S = (30, 60, 100)$ for 6 total scenarios. For each simulation scenario $j = 1, \dots, 6$ we set $\tau = 0.2$ and study-specific standard errors $s_i$, $i = 1, \dots, S$, are distributed as Uniform(0.2, 0.8). Study-specific true mean effects $\theta_i$ are distributed as $\theta_i \sim \text{N}(\theta, \tau^2)$. We then sample $y_i \sim \text{N}(\theta_i, s_i^2)$ as observed study effects. Each study $i$ is assigned a probability of publication $\alpha_i$ based on one of multiple selection functions which are chosen deliberately such that none of the stepped selection models or Copas models can individually capture the true selection mechanism. Whether or not each study $i$ is included in the meta-analysis is then determined by an indicator $B_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\alpha_i)$. 

Model performance is evaluated using bias, 95\% interval coverage, 95\% interval length, and root-mean squared error (RMSE). 

\subsection{Selection functions}

The first selection function $f_1(p)$ decreases with one-sided $p$-values, i.e. $p_i = 1 - \Phi(y_i / s_i)$. It is constant at $f_1(p) = 1$ for $p \in [0, 0.005)$. It then decreases exponentially as $f_1(p) = \exp(-2p)$ for $p \in [0.005, 0.2)$. There is then a step at $p=0.2$, and $f_1(p) = \exp(-4p)$ for $p \in [0.2, 0.5)$, and is constant at $f_1(p) = 0.1$ for $p \in [0.5, 1]$. See Figure [reference figure] for a graphical depiction.

\subsection{Simulation results}

We simulated $K=1000$ iterations for each scenario $j$.
